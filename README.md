# Project Sharing App (Working Title)

Our project is a web application which allows users to share tutorials 
that they have created. These tutorials can be for software projects, or 
for hardware projects which may require materials and tools. Once shared, 
other users may leave feedback, in the form of ratings, comments, and 
images, on the tutorial. Users may also compile collections of tutorials 
that they have made (or would like to make), and send messages to one 
another.
